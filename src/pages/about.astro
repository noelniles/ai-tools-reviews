    <h1>About AI Tools Reviews</h1>
    
    <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-300">
      We're on a mission to help you navigate the rapidly evolving world of AI tools with honest, in-depth reviews and real-world testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    
    <p>
      The AI tools landscape changes almost daily. New products launch, existing ones get major updates, and pricing models shift constantly. 
      It's overwhelming to keep up, let alone make informed decisions about which tools are worth your time and money.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where we come in. We test every tool extensively, benchmark performance across real use cases, and provide honest assessments 
      of what works, what doesn't, and who each tool is actually best for.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hands-on testing</strong> - We actually use these tools for weeks, not just read the marketing materials</li>
      <li><strong>Real benchmarks</strong> - Data-driven comparisons across multiple dimensions</li>
      <li><strong>Honest critiques</strong> - We call out limitations and overpriced features</li>
      <li><strong>Regular updates</strong> - AI tools evolve fast; we keep our reviews current</li>
      <li><strong>No BS</strong> - Clear verdicts on who should buy and who should skip</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Testing Process</h2>

    <p>
      For each tool, we spend 2-4 weeks testing across various scenarios. We measure performance quantitatively where possible, 
      compare against alternatives, and evaluate real-world value for different user types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our reviews include performance benchmarks, pricing analysis, feature comparisons, and honest assessments of strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency & Affiliate Links</h2>

    <p>
      We're committed to complete transparency. This site uses affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you purchase 
      a tool through our links. This comes at no extra cost to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Affiliate relationships do not influence our reviews. We maintain editorial independence and provide 
      honest assessments regardless of commission rates. Some of our most critical reviews are of tools with the best affiliate programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a tool is overpriced, buggy, or not worth it, we'll say so—even if it means losing potential commissions.
    </p>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
