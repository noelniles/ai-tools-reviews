          Former product manager at a SaaS company. Been testing AI tools since GPT-3 dropped in 2020. 
          Spent way too much money on subscriptions so you don't have to.

    <h2>Why I Started This Site</h2>
    
    <p>
      Look, I'll be honest with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      In early 2023, I was drowning in AI tool subscriptions. ChatGPT Plus, Midjourney, Jasper, Claude, Copy.ai, Notion AI... 
      my credit card statement looked like I was running a SaaS company myself. I was spending $400+/month on tools I barely understood.
    </p>

    <p>
      The breaking point? I paid $49 for a "revolutionary AI writing tool" that was literally just a worse version of ChatGPT with 
      a different UI. That's when I realized: <strong>most AI tool reviews are garbage</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      They're either:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Written by people who've never actually used the tool</li>
      <li>Paid promotional content disguised as reviews</li>
      <li>Copy-pasted feature lists from the company website</li>
      <li>Or just plain wrong (looking at you, "Top 10 AI Tools" listicles from 2022)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So I started testing everything myself. Canceling the crap. Keeping the winners. Taking notes. 
      And now, here we are.
    </p>

    <h2>My Testing Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      I use each tool for <strong>at least 2-4 weeks</strong> before writing a review. Not 20 minutes. Not watching a YouTube demo. 
      Actually using it for real work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's my process:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Daily use for actual projects (writing, coding, design, whatever the tool does)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Compare against 2-3 alternatives doing the exact same tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Test edge cases, limits, and the stuff the marketing doesn't mention</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I also track:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many times I actually choose it over alternatives</li>
      <li>What makes me frustrated (this is important)</li>
      <li>Whether I'd still use it if I had to pay for it myself</li>
      <li>If I recommend it to friends (the real test)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Biases (Yes, I Have Them)</h2>

    <p>
      Every reviewer has biases. Here are mine:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>I hate complicated UIs.</strong> If it takes me 10 minutes to figure out where the settings are, that's a problem.</li>
      <li><strong>I'm cheap.</strong> Free tier matters. A lot. I'll always test if the free version is good enough before recommending paid.</li>
      <li><strong>I prefer tools that do one thing really well</strong> over Swiss Army knife apps that do everything poorly.</li>
      <li><strong>I'm a Mac user</strong> (though I test on Windows when it matters).</li>
      <li><strong>I prioritize speed.</strong> If your AI takes 30 seconds to generate a response, I'm already annoyed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Knowing these helps you filter my recommendations. If you love complex tools with tons of features, we might disagree sometimes. That's fine.
    </p>

    <h2>The Affiliate Thing (Let's Talk About It)</h2>

    <p>
      Yeah, this site has affiliate links. When you click "Try ChatGPT Plus" and sign up, I get a commission. 
      That's how I pay for hosting, keep testing new tools, and justify spending 20+ hours a week on reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>But here's my rule:</strong> I will never—and I mean <em>never</em>—recommend a tool just because it has a good affiliate program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Case in point: I gave Jasper AI a 6.5/10 even though they had one of the best affiliate programs in the space (which they've 
      since ended, RIP). Meanwhile, I rated Cursor AI 9/10 and they didn't even have an affiliate program when I wrote that review.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a tool sucks, I'll tell you it sucks. Even if it costs me money.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way I see it: my reputation is worth way more than a few affiliate commissions. If I lose your trust by recommending garbage, 
      you'll never come back. And honestly? I'd rather have readers who trust me than a quick buck from a tool I don't believe in.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools I'm Currently Testing</h2>

    <p>
      As of January 2026, I'm actively testing:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>GPT-4's new reasoning updates (the improvement over GPT-4 Turbo is... interesting)</li>
      <li>Perplexity's new Pro features (jury's still out)</li>
      <li>Claude's latest vision capabilities (spoiler: pretty damn good)</li>
      <li>A bunch of AI video tools that claim to be "game-changing" (most aren't)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reviews coming soon. I don't rush these.
    </p>

    <h2>Want Me to Test Something?</h2>

    <p>
      Have a tool you want me to review? Disagree with one of my ratings? Think I missed something important?
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="/contact" class="text-brand hover:underline font-semibold">Send me a message</a>. 
      I read everything (though I can't always respond immediately—one-person operation here).
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-slate-400 mt-8">
      P.S. - If you're a tool founder trying to get me to review your product: I'm happy to test it, but I can't guarantee a positive review. 
      If that's cool with you, let's talk.
