## Otter.ai Features: What Makes It Essential for Meetings

Otter does more than simple transcription:

- **Real-time transcription** - Live captions during meetings
- **Speaker identification** - Automatically identifies who said what
- **AI summaries** - Auto-generated meeting notes
- **Action items extraction** - Pulls out tasks and deadlines
- **Zoom/Teams/Meet integration** - Joins meetings automatically
- **Shared notes** - Collaborative editing and comments
- **Searchable database** - Find any topic across all meetings
- **Recording** - Audio and video recording
- **Export options** - PDF, TXT, SRT formats
- **Mobile apps** - iOS and Android support

## Accuracy & Performance

Transcription accuracy is impressive (88-92%) in good conditions:

**Works well with**:
- Clear audio
- Professional microphones
- American/British accents
- Standard vocabulary
- One speaker at a time

**Struggles with**:
- Heavy accents
- Background noise
- Multiple overlapping speakers
- Technical jargon (initially—learns over time)
- Poor audio quality

The AI summary feature is hit-or-miss. Great for straightforward discussions, but misses nuance in complex conversations.

## Use Cases

### Remote Work

Essential for distributed teams:
- **Miss a meeting?** Read the full transcript
- **Need to reference decisions?** Search your meeting archive
- **Action items?** Auto-extracted and highlighted

### Interviews

For journalists, researchers, and recruiters:
- Focus on conversation, not note-taking
- Full transcript ready immediately after
- Easy to quote accurately

### Education

Students capture lectures:
- No frantic typing required
- Searchable transcripts for studying
- Highlight and organize key points

### Content Creation

Transcribe media for repurposing:
- Podcasts → blog posts
- Videos → articles
- Interviews → quotes and stories

### Accessibility

Provides real-time captions for hearing-impaired participants.

## Pricing

- **Free**: 300 minutes/month (10 hours), 30 min/conversation
- **Pro**: $10/user/month - 1200 minutes/month (40 hours)
- **Business**: $20/user/month - 6000 minutes/month, advanced features
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing - SSO, admin controls, dedicated support

Free tier is surprisingly capable for individual use. Teams need Business tier for full features.

## vs Alternatives

**vs Fireflies.ai**: Similar features, Otter has better UI. Fireflies has more integrations.

**vs Microsoft Teams native**: Otter more accurate and better search. Teams free with subscription.

**vs Rev.ai**: Rev more accurate but expensive. Otter better for regular meetings.

## Limitations

### Privacy Concerns

All audio sent to cloud - not suitable for:
- Confidential business meetings
- Legal discussions
- Healthcare conversations
- Sensitive client data

### Technical Limitations

- **Speaker limit** - Free tier struggles with 5+ people
- **Edit workflow** - Correcting transcripts is tedious and time-consuming
- **Integration quirks** - Occasional sync issues with Zoom/Google Calendar
- **Background noise** - Accuracy drops significantly in noisy environments

## Verdict

Otter has become indispensable for remote-first organizations. The ability to search across all meetings, generate summaries, and never miss action items transforms productivity.

Accuracy isn't perfect, but it's good enough that editing takes less time than manual note-taking. The free tier is genuinely useful, and paid plans are reasonable for the value delivered.

**Best for**: Remote teams, frequent meeting attendees, journalists/interviewers, students, sales teams, consultants.

**Skip if**: Rarely attend meetings, need enterprise compliance features, require offline transcription, uncomfortable with cloud recording.
