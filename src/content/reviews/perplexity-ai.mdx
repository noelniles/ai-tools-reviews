## Performance

Perplexity excels at research tasks and fact-finding. Unlike traditional chatbots that can hallucinate information, Perplexity grounds its responses in real web sources, making it significantly more reliable for factual queries.

In our testing, we found it particularly strong at:

- **Academic research** - Excellent for finding papers and scholarly sources
- **Comparison shopping** - Quickly synthesizes product reviews and specifications
- **Technical documentation** - Finds and explains API docs, tutorials, and guides
- **News analysis** - Aggregates multiple perspectives on breaking stories

The citation system is robust, typically providing 5-10 sources per answer. Each claim in the response is linked to its source, making it easy to verify information and dig deeper.
