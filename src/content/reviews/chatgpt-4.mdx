## Key Features

ChatGPT-4 brings a host of powerful capabilities that set it apart from both its predecessors and competitors:

- **Advanced reasoning and problem-solving** - Handles complex multi-step problems with improved logical consistency
- **Multimodal capabilities** - Accepts both text and image inputs, making it versatile for visual analysis tasks
- **Extended context window** - 128k tokens with Turbo variant allows processing of entire books or large codebases
- **Custom GPTs** - Create specialized versions tailored to specific tasks or domains without coding
- **DALL-E 3 integration** - Generate high-quality images directly within the chat interface
## Response Quality

GPT-4 excels at complex tasks including code generation, creative writing, and analytical reasoning. In our extensive testing, we found it particularly strong at maintaining context over long conversations, following nuanced instructions, and providing detailed explanations.

The model shows significantly improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations compared to GPT-3.5. While it's not perfect and can still make mistakes, it's much more likely to acknowledge uncertainty and provide caveats when appropriate. The writing quality is consistently high, with natural-sounding prose that adapts well to different tones and styles.

The combination of these features makes ChatGPT-4 incredibly versatile, capable of handling everything from casual conversation to complex technical analysis.
