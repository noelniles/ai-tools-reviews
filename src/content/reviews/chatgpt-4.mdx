I've been using ChatGPT-4 almost daily since March 2023, and honestly? It's ruined me for other AI assistants.

Not because it's perfect—it's not. But because when you get used to GPT-4's ability to actually *understand* what you're asking for, going back to GPT-3.5 (or most competitors) feels like downgrading from a Tesla to a golf cart. You can still get where you're going, but the experience is... different.

Let me be clear upfront: ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month. That's not nothing. But after testing it against every major alternative—including [Claude 3](/reviews/claude-3), [Gemini Pro](/reviews/gemini-pro), and [Perplexity AI](/reviews/perplexity-ai)—I keep my subscription active. Here's why.

## ChatGPT-4 vs Alternatives: My Testing Methodology

I tested ChatGPT-4 for 8 weeks straight (March-May 2024, then retested in January 2026 with the latest updates). Used it for:
- **Writing**: Blog posts, email responses, content rewrites
- **Coding**: Python scripts, debugging React components, SQL queries
- **Research**: Summarizing papers, comparing product features
- **Daily tasks**: Meal planning, trip itineraries, gift ideas

I compared it head-to-head against [Claude 3 Opus](/reviews/claude-3), [Gemini Advanced](/reviews/gemini-pro), and [Perplexity Pro](/reviews/perplexity-ai) for the same tasks. Kept detailed notes on what worked and what didn't. For AI image generation, I also tested [DALL-E 3 vs Midjourney](/reviews/midjourney).

## ChatGPT-4 Features That Actually Work

Look, I'm skeptical of most AI hype. But here's what genuinely surprised me about ChatGPT-4's capabilities:

      {

      }
    ]
  }}
/>

**1. It actually remembers context**

I had a conversation about a Python project across 4 different sessions over 2 weeks. GPT-4 remembered architectural decisions I'd made, variable names I'd used, and even a specific bug I mentioned in passing. That's... kind of wild.

With GPT-3.5, I'd have to re-explain my entire project every single time. With GPT-4, it just picks up where we left off.

**2. The reasoning is noticeably better**

Example: I asked it to debug a React component that was causing infinite re-renders. GPT-3.5 gave me generic advice about useEffect dependencies. GPT-4 actually walked through my code line by line, identified that I was creating a new object reference on every render, and suggested a specific fix using useMemo.

The fix worked. First try.

**3. Image analysis is surprisingly useful**

I wasn't expecting this to be a big deal, but it is. I've used it to:
- Debug CSS layout issues by uploading screenshots
- Analyze charts and extract data
- Get recipe ideas from photos of ingredients in my fridge
- Understand error messages in foreign languages

Is it perfect? No. But it's useful way more often than I expected.

**4. Custom GPTs are hit or miss**

OpenAI's marketplace is full of custom GPTs. Some are genuinely helpful (like the "Code Review" GPT that catches bugs I miss). Most are just... regular ChatGPT with a different system prompt. Don't get too excited about these.

## ChatGPT-4 Limitations: The Stuff Nobody Tells You

**It's slower than GPT-3.5**

Yeah, that's annoying. Especially during peak hours (US evenings). Sometimes I literally switch to GPT-3.5 for simple tasks just because I don't want to wait 5-10 seconds for a response.

**The rate limits are real**

ChatGPT Plus gives you "up to 40 messages every 3 hours" with GPT-4. That sounds like a lot until you're in the middle of a coding session and hit the limit. Then you're forced to either wait or downgrade to GPT-3.5.

This happened to me 3 times last week. Still annoying.

**It can still hallucinate**

Less than GPT-3.5, sure. But I caught it making up function names in a Python library just last month. Always verify code before running it, especially for anything important.

**Knowledge cutoff is April 2024**

As of December 2025, GPT-4's training data ends in April 2024. It doesn't know about events, products, or updates after that date (unless you enable web browsing, which is... fine but not great).

This means it'll confidently give you outdated information about anything recent. Just be aware.

## ChatGPT Plus Pricing: Is It Worth $20/Month?

Short answer: **Depends**.

Here's the pricing breakdown:
- **Free tier**: GPT-3.5 unlimited, GPT-4o mini
- **ChatGPT Plus**: $20/month - GPT-4, DALL-E 3, web browsing, custom GPTs, 40 messages/3 hours
- **API access**: $0.03/1K input tokens, $0.06/1K output tokens
- **Team/Enterprise**: $25-30+/user/month

**My honest take:**

If you're a student who just needs help with homework occasionally? **Stick with the free tier.** GPT-3.5 is fine for that.

If you're a developer, writer, or marketer who uses AI tools daily? **Worth every penny.** I tried canceling my subscription for a month to save money. I re-subscribed after 3 days.

If you're a business with 3+ people using it regularly? **Get the Team plan.** The admin features are actually useful (I tested this with a freelance team).

The API pricing is reasonable if you're building an app, but costs can spiral quickly with heavy usage. I spent $80 in API fees in one month testing a chatbot. Budget accordingly.

## My Honest Verdict

After 10 months of daily use, here's the truth:

**ChatGPT-4 is the best general-purpose AI assistant available right now.** Not because it's perfect (it's not), but because it consistently delivers good-to-great results across the widest range of tasks.

Claude 3 Opus beats it for writing quality. Gemini is faster. Perplexity is better for research. But GPT-4 is the only one I trust for everything from debugging code to planning my mom's birthday party.

Is it worth $20/month? For me, absolutely. I've canceled Netflix ($15/month) and kept ChatGPT Plus. That should tell you something.

But I'm also someone who uses AI tools 20+ times per day. If you're using it 3-4 times a week, stick with the free tier.

## Who Should Actually Use This

**Get ChatGPT Plus if you:**
- Use AI tools daily for work (writing, coding, research, analysis)
- Find yourself hitting rate limits on the free tier
- Need reliable, high-quality outputs and don't want to mess around
- Work with code, documents, or images regularly
- Can afford $20/month without stress

**Stick with free tier if you:**
- Only need occasional AI help (homework, simple questions)
- Are still exploring what AI tools can do
- Have a tight budget (seriously, no judgment—free tier is solid)
- Mainly use it for casual conversation or fun

**Consider alternatives if you:**
- Specifically need best-in-class writing → Try [Claude 3 Opus](/reviews/claude-3)
- Prioritize search/research → Try [Perplexity Pro](/reviews/perplexity-ai)
- Just need code help → [GitHub Copilot](/reviews/github-copilot) might be better value
- Want faster responses → [Gemini Advanced](/reviews/gemini-pro) is quicker
- Need AI image generation → Compare [DALL-E 3 vs Midjourney](/reviews/midjourney)

## Questions I Get Asked

**"Should I get Plus or just use the API?"**

If you're building an app → API. If you're using it personally → Plus. The Plus subscription is way better value for individual use.

**"What about GPT-4 Turbo?"**

It's faster and cheaper via API, but slightly lower quality. For most people, regular GPT-4 is worth the extra speed cost.

**"Can I share my Plus account?"**

Technically no. OpenAI's terms say one account per person. But... I'm not here to judge.

**Bottom line:** I keep my ChatGPT Plus subscription active, and I've tested literally every alternative. That's my review in one sentence.
