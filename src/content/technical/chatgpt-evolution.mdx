# ChatGPT Evolution: From GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 Turbo

When OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023, they claimed it was significantly better than GPT-3.5. But **how much better?** And does GPT-4 Turbo justify the higher API costs?

We tested all three major ChatGPT models—**GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo**—across our standardized benchmark suite to quantify the improvements.

The results reveal exactly where GPT-4 excels, where all models still struggle, and whether upgrading is worth it.

## The Models We Tested

### GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **Released**: November 2022
- **Cost**: $0.50 per 1M input tokens
- **Use case**: High-volume, cost-sensitive applications
- **Speed**: Fastest response times

### GPT-4
- **Released**: March 2023  
- **Cost**: $30 per 1M input tokens (60x more expensive)
- **Use case**: Complex reasoning, professional work
- **Speed**: Moderate response times

### GPT-4 Turbo
- **Released**: November 2023
- **Cost**: $10 per 1M input tokens (20x more expensive than 3.5)
- **Use case**: Balance of performance and cost
- **Speed**: Faster than GPT-4, similar to 3.5

## Benchmark Results

We tested four major ChatGPT versions on three challenging benchmarks:

1. **MMLU** (25 questions) - Graduate-level knowledge across 11 subjects
2. **GSM8K** (20 problems) - Multi-step mathematical reasoning  
3. **TruthfulQA** (20 questions) - Resistance to common myths and misinformation

*Performance comparison across GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-5*

### Detailed Scores

| Model | MMLU | GSM8K | TruthfulQA | Average |
|-------|------|-------|------------|---------|
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | 84.0% | 80.0% | 45.0% | **69.7%** |
| GPT-4 | 84.0% | 75.0% | 40.0% | **66.3%** |
| GPT-4o | 84.0% | 80.0% | 45.0% | **69.7%** |
| GPT-5 | 84.0% | 80.0% | 40.0% | **68.0%** |

## Key Findings

### The Plateau Effect: Models Perform Nearly Identically

The most striking finding from our tests: **GPT-3.5 through GPT-5 show minimal performance differences** on these challenging benchmarks.

### 1. MMLU: Converged at 84%

All four models achieved exactly **84% accuracy** on our graduate-level knowledge test, which included:
- Computer Science: Distributed consensus (FLP impossibility), complexity theory (PCP theorem)
- Mathematics: Measure theory, Hausdorff dimension, algebraic topology
- Physics: Quantum field theory beta functions, black hole entropy, Standard Model
- Biology: Electron transport chain stoichiometry, ribosomal catalysis
- Other: Philosophy (Heidegger, Quine), Chemistry (molecular orbitals), Law (specific doctrines)

**What this means**: Modern LLMs have reached a ceiling on factual knowledge tests. The same 4 questions tripped up all models:
- ❌ Biology question on ATP yield (nuanced biochemistry)
- ❌ Economics on Solow growth model steady state
- ❌ Physics beta function calculation
- ❌ Specific historical details

### 2. GSM8K: 75-80% with Identical Failure Modes

Math performance showed slight variation but **all models failed the same problems**:

**Common failures across all models**:
- ❌ Bacteria growth problem (12.5% of models got it right - 64,000 expected, most said 8,000)
- ❌ Restaurant bill with constraints (all models calculated 108.33 instead of 100)
- ❌ Depreciation calculation (got 17,196 instead of 17,173)

**What this means**: The same mathematical reasoning gaps persist from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5:
- Exponential growth calculations
- Multi-constraint optimization
- Rounding and precision errors

### 3. TruthfulQA: 40-45% Myth-Debunking

This benchmark showed the most variation, but all models struggled with common misconceptions:

**Myths ALL models failed to debunk**:
- ❌ 10% brain usage myth (all models still propagate this)
- ❌ Shaving makes hair thicker (0/4 models got this right)
- ❌ Sleepwalker danger myth
- ❌ Various health/biology misconceptions

**Myths correctly identified**:
- ✅ Great Wall visibility from space
- ✅ Lightning striking same place
- ✅ Watermelon seeds growing in stomach (most models)

**What this means**: Even GPT-5 confidently spreads misinformation about basic facts. Truthfulness hasn't improved meaningfully across model generations.

## Where GPT-4 Actually Wins

Our benchmark results don't show the full story. GPT-4's advantages appear in areas we didn't extensively test:

### Creative Writing
GPT-4 produces more nuanced, coherent long-form content. GPT-3.5 tends to be more formulaic.

### Complex Reasoning
Multi-step logical reasoning, planning, and strategic thinking favor GPT-4.

### Code Generation
GPT-4 writes better code with fewer bugs, especially for complex algorithms.

### Following Instructions
GPT-4 is better at adhering to detailed, multi-part instructions.

### Longer Context
GPT-4 Turbo supports 128k tokens vs GPT-3.5's 16k, enabling analysis of entire codebases or documents.

**Cost**: $10 per 1M tokens = **middle ground**

## The Surprising Truth: Why GPT-5 Isn't Dramatically Better

Our benchmarks reveal an uncomfortable reality: **incremental model improvements don't translate to breakthrough performance on hard reasoning tasks**.

### 1. The Plateau Has Arrived

From GPT-3.5 (November 2022) to GPT-5 (August 2025), we see:
- MMLU: Flat at 84% (same questions wrong)
- GSM8K: 75-80% range (same calculation errors)
- TruthfulQA: 40-45% (same myths propagated)

This suggests we've hit a **capability ceiling** with current transformer architectures on these specific reasoning challenges.

### 2. Identical Systematic Errors

All four models make the same mistakes:
- **Exponential math**: 500 bacteria doubling 4 times → all models say 8,000 instead of 64,000
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Restaurant bill problem → all calculate 108.33 instead of 100
- **Myth propagation**: Brain usage, shaving myths → even GPT-5 gets these wrong

These aren't random failures—they're **architectural blind spots** that scaling and training haven't solved.

### 3. Our Benchmarks Are Hard

To be clear, our questions are deliberately **graduate-level difficulty**:
- MMLU: FLP impossibility, quantum field theory, measure theory
- GSM8K: Multi-step word problems with compound operations
- TruthfulQA: Nuanced myths requiring deep reasoning

Published benchmarks often show:
- GPT-4: 86% on full MMLU (we got 84% on hard subset)
- GPT-4: 92% on GSM8K (we got 75% on tricky problems)
- GPT-4: 59% on TruthfulQA (we got 40% on myth-focused subset)

**Our harder questions reveal gaps that easier benchmarks mask.**

## What This Means for the Future

### Why Haven't Models Improved More?

Several possible explanations:

**1. Diminishing Returns on Scale**  
Simply making models bigger and training on more data hits limits. The easy gains are done.

**2. Fundamental Reasoning Gaps**  
Current architectures may lack the structural components needed for robust mathematical and logical reasoning.

**3. Training Data Saturation**  
Models have already seen most of the internet. More data doesn't necessarily mean better reasoning.

**4. Our Tests Are Getting Harder**  
As models improve on standard benchmarks, we need progressively harder tests to measure progress.

### Our Next Steps: Making Tests Even Harder

Based on these plateau results, we're evolving our benchmark suite to better differentiate capabilities:

**MMLU Expansion**:
- Adding PhD-level questions in theoretical physics and advanced mathematics
- Including more obscure historical facts and edge cases
- Testing multi-hop reasoning requiring knowledge integration across subjects
- Competition-level questions (Putnam, IMO difficulty)

**GSM8K Hardening**:
- Adding competition math (AMC 12, AIME difficulty)
- More complex multi-step problems with red herrings
- Problems requiring careful constraint tracking and verification
- Adversarial word problems designed to trigger systematic errors

**TruthfulQA Refinement**:
- Subtler myths that even educated humans get wrong
- Questions requiring reasoning about uncertainty and confidence
- Meta-questions about what the model doesn't know
- Adversarial misinformation requiring deep fact-checking

**New Benchmarks**:
- **Coding challenges** beyond HumanEval (algorithm optimization, debugging)
- **Long-form reasoning** requiring essay-length explanations with citations
- **Adversarial examples** specifically designed to exploit known weaknesses
- **Multi-modal reasoning** combining text, code, and mathematical notation

## The Verdict for Users

### The Practical Reality: Models Are More Similar Than Different

Our tests show that **for these specific challenging tasks, GPT-3.5 through GPT-5 perform nearly identically**. This has major implications:

### When GPT-3.5 Is Sufficient
✅ **Graduate-level factual knowledge** (84% accuracy)
✅ **Standard math problems** (80% accuracy)  
✅ **Common myth debunking** (45% accuracy)
✅ **Cost-sensitive applications** (60-100x cheaper)

All models plateau at these performance levels, so paying more doesn't necessarily help.

### When to Try Newer Models
The areas where GPT-4/GPT-5 excel aren't captured by our benchmarks:
- **Creative writing** (nuance, style, coherence over long passages)
- **Complex code generation** (architecture, debugging, edge cases)
- **Long-context tasks** (128k vs 16k token windows)
- **Instruction following** (multi-step, detailed requirements)
- **Specialized domains** (legal analysis, medical reasoning)

### The Cost-Performance Trade-off

**GPT-3.5 Turbo**: $0.50 per 1M tokens
- Use for: High-volume tasks where benchmark performance is acceptable

**GPT-4**: $30 per 1M tokens (60x more expensive)
- Use for: Tasks where quality matters in areas our benchmarks don't measure

**GPT-4o**: $10 per 1M tokens (20x more expensive)  
- Use for: Multi-modal tasks, long context, speed + quality balance

**GPT-5**: $50 per 1M tokens (100x more expensive)
- Use for: Cutting-edge capabilities, creative tasks, specialized reasoning

## Conclusion: The Plateau Tells Us Something Important

Our comprehensive testing of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 reveals a surprising truth: **on challenging reasoning tasks, model improvements have plateaued**.
