## Notes

**Critical times to be awake/available:**
- Tuesday 3:00am-7:00am HST (Reddit + HN initial engagement)
- Tuesday 9:00am-11:00am HST (follow-up responses)

**Can sleep through:**
- Twitter thread posts (automated)
- LinkedIn posts (automated)
- Dev.to cross-posts (automated)

**Sounding human:**
- Pre-write responses to common questions
- But customize each one when you paste
- Add typos occasionally (not in posts, in comments)
- Vary response length
- Show genuine engagement, not just copy-paste

**Emergency backup:**
If you can't wake up at 3-4am:
- Post at 7-8am HST (12pm-1pm EST) - less optimal but still works
- Reddit is 24/7, just slower growth
- HN still gets eyeballs afternoon EST
